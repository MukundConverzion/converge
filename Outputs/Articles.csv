As India celebrates its 70th year of independence, I am more sanguine about its prospects than I’ve been for a number of years. In the short-term, India still has a number of headwinds it needs to wrestle through. The cyclical investment climate continues to be soft, and the banking sector is weighed down by non-performing loans. On the positive, many of the measures of the current Modi administration are a boon for the business climate, and starting to filter through.
All in, I believe India’s economy has bottomed out and will pick up pace in the next few years. As we look out further into the medium-term, I am even more bullish about India’s prospects. Indeed, I am convinced that the structural rise of India will be one of Asia’s big stories in the next 20 years, powered by a few themes:
Consumption. Today, India is primarily a consumer-based economy with services accounting for about 65-70% of GDP. Household income is growing, as is the middle class, and this has been the main driver of India’s annual GDP growth of 7-8%. A number of structural tailwinds can be expected to further fuel India’s consumption boom. One of them is India’s growing youthful population – unlike the G3 and many Asian economies, its working age population has not peaked. Forecasts are that between 2015 and 2040, its working population will rise from 66% to 68% of total population. Second, India’s household leverage remains relatively low – household debt to GDP is at about 10%, compared to 40% for China and 60% for Singapore – so there is plenty of room for the consumer credit market to support any growing consumption appetite.
Investment. The Modi government’s strong emphasis on manufacturing has revived what was previously a stagnant sector, and made it competitive again. India is today the sixth largest manufacturing nation in the world, from ninth place, and “Make in India” is growing in brand cache internationally. Between October 2014 and March 2016, foreign direct investments to the tune of USD 100 billion have poured into India across diverse sectors, attracted by the country’s liberal investment regime as well as more favourable business climate. A strong manufacturing sector and export competitiveness will be India’s next big driver of growth, after consumption.
Favourable policy actions and reforms. Fiscal devolution from the centre to state governments, simplification of the tax structure, encouragement of foreign direct investment, use of e-auctions to award business contracts, promotion of digitalisation as well as implementation of social sector programmes such as financial inclusion, are examples of policy actions by the Modi government in recent years. All of them are in the right direction, and either enhance productivity, plug leakages, improve transparency or directly bolster the economy. While in the short-term, the impact may not be that visible, these measures will have significant long-term impact.
Taken together, India’s consumption boom, investment and export drive, as well positive policy actions should enable the economy to achieve sustainable growth of 8-10% over the next couple of decades.
There are a couple of things to be watchful of, though. The first is that unless carefully harnessed, India’s growing youthful population could turn out to be not a demographic dividend but a demographic disaster. Whether it is one or the other turns on India’s ability to ramp up jobs creation by some 15-20 million a year, as well as provide meaningful skills training for this expanding workforce. Growth in manufacturing, as well as the SME and startup sector will help in some of the labour absorption. Modi has also set a target of training about 400 million people by 2022. Skills development is an area of cooperation between Singapore and India, and Singapore’s Institute of Technical Education has agreed to help set up three centres in the area of tourism skills development. Two – in Delhi and Udaipur – are already running and a third is being planned in Assam.
Another potential fly in the ointment is India’s banking system which is enmeshed in non-performing loans. Unlike some other governments, the Indian government does not have the fiscal capacity to take the write-offs and recapitalise the banks in one shot, so recovery of the sector is likely to be somewhat protracted. This means availability of capital to fund economic growth in the near-term remains constrained.
While these are not small challenges, I am optimistic about India’s future. The long-term structural trends, coupled with the ease-of-doing-business measures being implemented, are powerful forces that should enable India to be one of Asia’s biggest stories.

1,"3,809 Likes",The Future of Banking,"Be it the macroeconomy, geopolitics or technological changes, we are living in a world of radical uncertainty. Not only do we have to grapple with a world of tepid growth, this fourth industrial revolution – the digital revolution – that we are in, is disrupting whole industries from retail to music. Banking is no exception. In fact, the surprise is that our industry has not been disrupted sooner, being arguably the most digitisable of industries, being made up of bits and bytes. This is in part due to psychology – people think about money a bit differently than they do other things – and in part due to regulatory barriers, but now, the tipping point has come.
The threat banks face has been precipitated by huge shifts in technology – mobile, the social/networked economy, Big Data, artificial intelligence, etc – and fintech companies are attacking every aspect of the financial services value chain, from payments, to lending, to capital markets. This is changing the face of banking dramatically.
And since, as Bill Gates famously said: “People don’t need banks, they need banking”, our lunch is in danger of being eaten by fintech companies who are beginning to do banking better, smarter, cheaper, and more intelligently than banks are.
There are four key factors driving this challenge:
The ubiquity of the smartphone. The mobile changes the nature of banking, because it not only puts massive computing power into customers’ hands, it makes location and context extremely important. It renders the paradigm of going to a bank, or an ATM, or even interfacing with the desktop irrelevant. With the smartphone, banking does not have to be an independent activity but is one that is embedded into customers’ lives, integrated with everything they do.
Rise of the social/networked economy. Unlike in the past, when companies produced and consumers consumed, Uber and Airbnb have made quite clear that we are in the age of the ‘prosumer’. In this world, anybody can sit at home and be part of a global distribution system. The ability of companies to link to each other through APIs, and to collaborate, has led to the democratisation of capacity and innovation. There is no longer a premium on scale.
Explosion of Big Data. 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone; the volume of cross-border data flows has grown 45x since 2005. Couple this with the sharp fall in data storage costs and the massive computing power able to analyse this data, and it’s clear that a huge part of the battle for the customer will be fought along data lines.
Artificial intelligence and cognitive learning. 20 years ago, the computer beat a human playing chess. Six years ago, it beat a human playing Jeopardy. Last year, it beat a human playing Go. Computers have begun to learn to think like us, and learn like us, improving as they go along.
A number of fintech companies have begun to pull together these technologies in a big way, and have made serious incursions into our space in a short span of time.
Take Alibaba. It is one the biggest payment companies in the world. It transfers more money through Alipay than many banks. It does hundreds of millions of transactions. It is one of the fastest fund gatherers in the world. Yu’e Bao hit USD 100 billion in just over a year, and today, is the world’s largest money market fund. It has a rapidly growing loan book, and extended RMB 50 billion of loans to SMEs and provided credit lines to over 100 million individuals for Singles’ Day last November. Its cost of credit is lower than many banks.
TransferWise moves over £1 billion every month and claims a 10% market share of the international transfer market in the UK, more than any other bank besides the major four. Robinhood, a zero-fee, stock-trading app, has hit USD 50 billion in total transaction volume in just over two years.
While banks can no longer afford to be complacent, and the pressure to innovate is very real, in the near term, it is not clear who will win: start-up or incumbent. Fintech companies do not have a monopoly on technology, and there is no reason for banks not to leverage the technology available. In the past, banks have been handicapped by our legacy tech architecture and mindset. But if we are able to transform these, and combine them with our innate strengths, including our robust networks and infrastructure, established risk management capabilities and trust factor, we can still do well.
A case in point: in April last year, DBS launched digibank, India’s first mobile-only bank that is paperless, branchless and signatureless. digibank combined a suite of groundbreaking technologies from biometrics to AI. In one year alone, we acquired 1 million new customers, without a single one of them going to a branch.
Looking into the future
Over the medium-term, however, banks are likely to come under further pressure, for a number of reasons.
First, banks have traditionally operated as pipe companies, facilitating money flows in the global monetary system. As competition from fintech companies intensifies, however, banks will have to ensure that they provide a seamless banking experience integrated with customers’ daily lives. The way forward is to make the shift from pipe company to platform company.
An example of a highly successful platform company is China’s Tencent, which enables customers to chat, purchase and pay for goods and services, including financial products, within its WeChat application. In many jurisdictions, banks do not have the latitude to do likewise, being constrained by regulators to operating within the narrow confines of financial services, and being a fiduciary business.
To the extent that regulations remain uneven across financial services and fintech companies, the future of banking will be increasingly challenged. The good news for banks is that this is changing. Recognising that the line between financial and non-financial business is blurring, Singapore’s central bank recently announced proposals to allow banks to expand into related businesses including e-commerce.
Second, the rise of blockchain/distributed ledger technology will supplant the current financial market infrastructure. The traditional ‘hub and spoke’ model, whereby a single institution, such as a bank, acts as the hub and disseminates information to individuals, will be disrupted.
Traditionally, banks have been seen as trusted guardians of financial activity, whether it is in safekeeping deposits, extending credit or facilitating payments. With the distributed ledger, however, anyone can digitally access anything of value – stocks, bonds, digital property, titles, deeds – quickly, securely, transparently and inexpensively, without the need for an intermediary. As the distributed ledger is a peer-to-peer model, all individuals are able to transact directly with each other without the need for a middleman.
Lastly, if societies become cashless, the role of banks will also change completely. The Nordic countries are fast heading towards being cashless, and a similar picture can be seen in countries like China and India in Asia. With the rise of digital payments and digital cash, we are moving from a world where money was gold-backed, to the present one where it is fiat-backed, to a future where it will be electronic.
Couple this with distributed ledger technology and, technically, we could reach a stage where central banks could directly distribute digital currencies to every citizen in the world. Today, over 90 central banks are engaged in distributed ledger discussions worldwide, and the UK is currently undertaking long-term research into the implications of creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC).
In a speech last year, Victoria Cleland, chief cashier of the Bank of England, said the CBDC could be limited to a narrow set of players such as financial institutions. But it could also be widened such that businesses and households are able to hold balances in central bank money and to pay each other in real time with full and final settlement, in an electronic format.
“There are numerous implications to be thought through … providing wide access to CBDC could fundamentally change the structure of the financial system. For example, if a CBDC provided competition for commercial bank deposits, one outcome could be a reduction in deposit funding available to commercial banks, undermining their ability to provide credit to consumers. The risks that this could pose need to be fully explored and understood,” she said.
It’s radical thinking that the world’s policymakers are already looking at.
Will we see a future without banks? If we look far out enough, anything is possible.

2,832 Likes,Belt and Road Initiative: implications for Asia and Singapore,"Last month, I had the privilege of attending the “Belt and Road” forum in Beijing, China’s biggest diplomatic event this year. The summit gathered heads of 29 nations, over 60 international organisations including the IMF and World Bank, and many private organisations. Since that gathering, much ink has been spilt on what One Belt One Road, since renamed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) augurs for Asia and the rest of the world. Not surprisingly, reactions have been mixed, with supporters applauding China’s leadership in an increasingly inward-looking world and detractors concerned about its growing influence and hegemonic ambitions. My view is that both commercially and ideologically, BRI offers many benefits to us here in Asia, and closer to home, in Singapore.
The commercial view
As Asia urbanises and the middle class becomes larger, the need for basic public utilities – transport, power and water continues to increase. In fact, the Asian Development Bank recently suggested that Asian countries need as much as USD 1.7 trillion of infrastructure investment every year until 2030. This is a massive need which can be partially met from within Asia, particularly by economies like China and Japan with their large savings pools. The problem is that, in the past, these surpluses have tended to go to the West, often to the US, instead of being intermediated in the region itself. This has left deficit Asian countries with huge infrastructure investment requirements - Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan - no better off. 
With BRI, I believe this long-time issue can finally be addressed. In some ways, Asia today can be likened to Europe after the Second World War. Then, Europe had a significant infrastructure requirement, but needed capital from the US in the form of the Marshall Plan. Fast-forward to the present day: while China will not be able to finance Asia’s infrastructure need all on its own, with its significant savings surpluses and capital, it can catalyse a similar kind of Marshall Plan for Asia.
BRI also opens up significant opportunities for Asian companies, with the most obvious industries standing to benefit being power, transportation, water and infrastructure. Commercial banks as well as debt and equity capital markets also have a role to play in complementing policy banks like AIIB in greasing the wheels of commerce, financing trade, enabling working capital efficiencies and providing hedging solutions.
Closer to home, I believe Singapore has a number of intrinsic strengths that it can leverage on, allowing it to seize the many opportunities afforded by BRI.
Singapore is a very important financial hub. Singapore is one of the places where large amounts of capital gathers: it is the second-largest wealth management centre in the world, the third-largest financial market centre, and perhaps the number one commodities hub. As much as 60% of all project finance in Southeast Asia is arranged by Singapore domiciled banks. As a global financial centre, Singapore is able to intermediate both capital and trade as it goes out from China into the rest of the world. Singapore also does the reverse. It is an extremely good hub to raise capital back into China. As Chinese capital markets open and Chinese companies are able to access global bond markets, Singapore is extremely well-positioned to facilitate that process.
Singapore has a role as honest broker. The fact is, geopolitics sometimes comes along with economic and commercial considerations. In several markets and several countries, the ability for Chinese investment to go independently is often challenging. Being able to partner with Singapore, and being able to use Singapore as a conduit for their investments often makes those investments and projects a lot more palatable.
Singapore has a lot of world-class companies that can partner with Chinese companies. With BRI, there are opportunities and projects in the port, construction and offshore marine sectors for example. In a range of different industries, there are world-class Singapore companies which can prove to be extremely useful partners in being able to drive joint activity with Chinese collaborators around the region.
The ideological view
Beyond the commercial benefits, BRI is also significant ideologically.
It heralds an important transition in the standard bearer for globalisation. For 60 years, the United States has been a key driver of free trade and free-market capitalism. Under President Trump, this is being rolled back; likewise, in Europe, post-Brexit, globalisation is also in retreat. Against this backdrop, it is significant that China is stepping up to champion an interconnected world. This marks an important shift in ideology in the world’s biggest economies.
It underlines a strong belief in the value of interconnectedness. Throughout history, the theory of comparative advantage – that countries benefit from trading with each other – has been well borne out. In a 2015 report, the World Trade Organisation said that since 2000, the developing country share of world trade increased from 33% to 48%. With growing trade, there was also stronger economic growth and poverty reduction. Between 1990 and 2015, the number of people living in extreme poverty had fallen by about a billion. The backlash from globalisation has mostly come from Western societies. When globalisation is blamed, the problem really lies with domestic policy, and the fact that domestic policy has not kept pace with the possibilities that global capital and trade co-create.
BRI is not about China trying to propagate the Chinese way in other nations, but a recognition that being in a world where there is free flow of goods and capital, exchange of ideas and interaction among cultures, is inevitable. 
At Davos earlier this year, President Xi Jinping had said, “Whether you like it or not, the global economy is the big ocean that you cannot escape from. Any attempt to cut off the flow of capital, technologies, products, industries and people between economies, and channel the waters in the ocean back into isolated lakes and creeks is simply not possible. Indeed, it runs counter to the historical trend.”
Ultimately, I believe that BRI is not just an initiative that helps China, or helps China export surplus capacity, or helps China create a sphere of influence. It has positive consequence for the livelihood of large numbers of people and the future of an interconnected world.

3,636 Likes,What a Trump-led US augurs for Asia and markets this year,"If 2016 was considered uncertain, this year will be exponentially so. Donald Trump will be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States today, and already, there are grave concerns over the implications of his presidency. In a world already in flux, what kind of 2017 might Trump’s leadership foreshadow, especially for those of us here in Asia?
Similar to most people, I started with a lot of concern about what the Trump presidency means and all the things that could go wrong. Much of Trump’s rhetoric and many of his statements have been deeply unnerving, putting many people on edge. I believe the Trumtweets will continue, and markets will see-saw through the year. More importantly, there is a real possibility of accidents as people react to his flippant comments in real time. However, that notwithstanding, my base case, which offers a little more optimism than most people have, is that he will do less damage than most people think, and that the global economy in 2017 may well surprise on the upside.
I base my views on two broad considerations:
I believe that the US economy has a lot more momentum and strength than is currently being forecasted, and contrary to popular belief, growth is not a zero sum game. A strong US economy actually lifts a lot of boats around the world. This is further coupled with short term resilience in Europe (Germany in particular is quite strong), and a degree of stability in China, where there is every incentive to cushion the economy going into the year-end Standing Committee elections.
While Trump has indulged in a lot of demagoguery over the past months, the Trump who will show up to work will be Trump the businessman, not Trump the demagogue.
US economy, and its global impact
Trump is inheriting a US economy which is looking pretty good. In recent quarters, consumption has improved notably. Consumer confidence is at a high. Retail sales continue to move upwards, and housing prices in many large cities have rebounded to pre-financial crisis levels. This has a wealth effect, so despite the deleveraging in some quarters, consumers feel wealthier and this should put support under consumption.  
The labour market is near full employment. Unemployment rate hit a nine-year low of 4.6% in November last year. This is showing up in rising wages, which is a catalyst for continued robustness in consumer demand. 
So far, the only fly in the ointment is business investment. This is likely to get positive impetus if Trump does end up pushing through tax reforms, which will spur domestic investments. Fiscal stimulus, albeit small, should also create investment in the economy.
Taking all this into account, the US economy may finally break through the shackles of the 2% GDP we’ve seen for the last four to five years. We’re likely to see a GDP growth rate this year of 2.5% to 3%. This momentum in the US economy is important because it will drive global growth, and we should therefore expect to see a pickup in Asia.
Generally, the narrative has been that if the US is strong, money will move out of Asia and everybody will go to the US. Historically, that happens for a few months but a strong America always has outbound investments. The correlation between a higher USD and Asian equity is very positive, for example.
If we look at the November and December data, production and export data for Japan is looking very good – a weak yen and very strong US dollar helps. Japan pencilling in 0.5%, 0.6% growth is a surprising upside. Taiwan and Singapore data also saw a pop. Around the region, by and large, Asia’s export agents tend to benefit from positivity in the US.
Trump the businessman, and his likely path
Trump is a businessman at heart. What stands out is that his instincts are big business and this shows up in his choice of a Cabinet. For the longest time, the US has not had such a pro-business Cabinet. Everybody is from a deep business background – the people who run large companies, who have a keen interest in being able to drive business activities around the world.
This winter, I also took the opportunity to read Trump’s book “Trump: The Art of the Deal”. I was struck by how he operates – his strategy around negotiation is to first take an extreme position, then work back and try to negotiate a deal that is advantageous to his side but not extreme. This can be seen in his election campaign and his rhetoric. My belief is that he is intrinsically such a deal-maker that ultimately, his business instincts will come to the fore.
Uncertainty will be a main driver in 2017
What could go wrong?
Trade protectionism. Trump and the Cabinet could tick the boxes, make a lot of noise about people taking jobs from America, shut some plants in Mexico or apply anti-dumping duties on China. I expect them to do that. But trade protectionism hurts the US more than many people think, and my sense is that Trump will likely end up making some cosmetic changes only. However, if the US does wind up being a very protectionist state, then all bets are off. Still, my own bias is that I don’t think we will see that much of that.
A much faster interest rate hike cycle in the US than people are taking into account right now. We could see a lot of uncertainty on the back of that.
Geopolitics. Beyond what Trump says and how China might respond, uncertainty also comes with China trying to establish its hegemony in this part of the world. The rising power is always trying to spread its elbows. In some ways, the next three to five years could actually be seminal on that account.
I’m sometimes struck by how quickly the British empire unravelled. Think about Great Britain – within a 10-year period after the end of the Second World War, the Commonwealth disappeared. When things start unravelling, they happen very quickly.
If Trump does follow through on his agenda of reversing from American exceptionalism and looking at some degree of US withdrawal from the Middle East, NATO alliances, the alliance with Japan and from a presence in Asia, that will create an opportunity for China to try to fill in the vacuum very quickly. Some of the measures and the policy announcements we’ve seen from China are actually indicative of that.
Each of these factors create a degree of uncertainty which is, frankly, very unusual.
On balance, however, I believe we will see the US economy continue to gain momentum, and if so, this year will offer opportunities. The risks, however, are real. We will need to be very careful and thoughtful.

4,723 Likes,Why I’m keeping the faith with China,"To many, the start of 2016 likely portends an annus horribilis. The carnage in China’s stock markets last week, sparked by downbeat manufacturing data, rattled stocks from US to Europe. The depreciating yuan is also unnerving investors.
Are the Chinese authorities losing their grip on the China economy, and is the world’s second-largest economy coming off the rails? Notwithstanding the market rout in China, and the present market volatility besetting markets, sitting where I am in Asia, I do not believe China is falling off a cliff. 
Last Monday, everyone got spooked by China’s PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index) data, which stayed under 50, signifying contraction, for the fifth month in a row.  However, given what China is seeking to accomplish, PMI is completely the wrong metric to look at, for one important reason: the contraction in industry and manufacturing is being engineered by the Chinese. This is part of a calibrated policy outcome.  For five years, the world told the Chinese they were overinvested, and needed to scale back on overcapacity and manufacturing. There was a clamour for China to shift to a consumption economy. And for the last two years, the Chinese have been focused on trying to do just that. So it should come as no surprise that China’s PMI should come in at below 50, and why I think focusing on this metric is not sensible.
The reality is that a) China’s service sector is growing quite nicely (PMI at over 54 in the same period) and b) the slowdown in manufacturing/investment reflects a need to clean up excess capacity in several sectors, notably construction, steel etc., but this does not mean that China’s heydays as an investment destination are over. China’s big problem has been a misallocation of resources, and they will need more than a couple of years to address the problems that arise from this. Nevertheless, it is instructive to note that overall, China’s actual investment (capital-output ratio, capital-labour ratio) is a fraction of the US. There are large parts of China, including healthcare, services and the environmental sectors, which are massively underinvested. What this means is there is scope and capacity for China to pump-prime the economy, and it has done so with some measure of success: while the PMI data is below 50, this has been inching up in the last couple of months.
A lot of people accuse me sometimes of being a China bull and overly sanguine about the risk in China. However, I want to differentiate my view of the macroeconomy from my view of China risks. The two are not the same thing. China risks are real, but they are concentrated in two areas:
a) Financial market volatility due to China’s attempt to open up, but still fine-tune through policy actions.
China’s authorities are focused on financial sector liberalisation, and the pace at which this has taken place has been faster than expected. For example, the Stock Connect was introduced, quotas on QFII were relaxed, and ceilings on deposit rates removed, all in the last 15 months. The free flow of markets has impacted many of China’s asset classes.  It is a truism that when you start to drive financial sector market liberalisation reform, there will be financial market volatility.
This is compounded by the fact that while China is attempting to open up, it is also seeking to fine-tune market responses through policy actions. And these policy decisions are taken by a myriad of people, regulators and government agencies. A lot of people think China is one person: that Xi Jinping makes all the decisions.  That would be simplistic in a nation of 1.3 billion people. In reality, the central authority in Beijing, the PBOC, CSRC, CBRC etc, have different agendas. Different people march to different tunes. While policies are broadly orchestrated, not everything is carefully calibrated each time. One may therefore find oneself on the wrong side of policy responses. 
b) Credit risk/corporate defaults. Anti corruption, SOE reform and depreciating yuan will put pressure on many companies.
China is cracking down on corruption, and this drive could create risks for companies related to affected individuals, creating idiosyncratic counterparty risks. China is also pursuing SOE reform, which means less competitive companies will be weaned out.  
To top this off, I believe the depreciation of the yuan will likely result in a good number of corporate defaults. In fact, I daresay that the currency depreciation is perhaps the single biggest risk to focus on this year.
While the yuan has been falling, China will continue to let its currency depreciate because exports are proving to be a drag. China does have a massive export trade surplus of $160 billion a quarter, however, that is coming down. It will therefore have a bias to let its currency depreciate relative to the dollar, even if this is held steady relative to the basket. This is a risk to watch because there has been a lot of Chinese corporate borrowing, much of which dollar-denominated, in the last year or two. A lot of this is unhedged. As the yuan depreciates, it is likely that a significant number of Chinese corporates will find their capacity to service debts will be challenged; this would be reminiscent of what Southeast Asia saw in 1998.
All in, China has risks, and they are clearly real risks. However, I do not believe that China’s macro economy is the point of concern. China’s economy is growing at 6-7%, and will continue to grow at this pace. What is more worrying is that the year will be marked by significant market volatility, more corporate defaults and higher counterparty risk. Nevertheless, if one is smart, understands the long game and chooses opportunities wisely, I believe China is still a good place to be invested in.",Piyush Gupta,"Publish date January 13, 2016",https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-im-keeping-faith-china-piyush-gupta/
