7,"Cannes Lions - Better business model than the agencies involved with it.
Total Entries : 41 770
Total Awards: Approx 1400
Chance to win: 3.5%
Average Cost per entry:  €755
Combined average entry fee: €31 553 754

Think about that. Over €30 million in fees alone, and people are going crazy about Publicis not wanting to submit awards for a year.

The awards scheme for advertising has just become a joke. If all of that money was saved and put into paying staff properly, perhaps paying for overtime or hiring new staff, or even potentially giving people a bonus when work performs well so that people aren't so crazily overworked and burnt out then agencies might have a chance of surviving against the major consulting companies like PWC and Accenture who are obliterating them and the traditional agency business model in general.","128 Likes

Another fun piece of interactive VR work put together by iris Labs for Aon. Working together with our Chicago office we created an interactive skiing game with powerups, high scores and lots of exciting extra bits and pieces. Since this was done at multiple events we embedded Google Analytics in to track how people were using it, combining it with video footage from the event we were able to figure out some strengths and weaknesses and really push it for the second event.

Due to the interactive versions of VR projects requiring high end devices, we wanted to allow people everywhere to try the experience too. Thus a 360 VR video was created that allowed us to push the quality levels far beyond what is capable in real time. 100% crafted in house with iris Labs with Unreal Engine 4.

22,"One of the worst examples of VR I have seen in recent times. 360 video, but 180 degrees of it blurred out. Fast, jarring movements that will make you vomit if you watch it in an actual VR headset. Terrible, low quality CGI sequence. I am amazed that this kind of thing gets past any creative team let alone the client. It is however a great example of what happens when you just try and tack technology onto an idea to take advantage of a fad. VR and AR are amazing technologies, don't just stick them in for a bit of PR","26 Likes
